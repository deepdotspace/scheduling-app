/**
 * Scope guard for the `/api/files/*` proxy.
 *
 * This app does not use scoped R2 storage at all: nothing in src/ calls
 * `useR2Files`, uploads a file, or renders a stored file URL — every `<img>`
 * source is either the auth provider's avatar URL or an external QR-code
 * service. The proxy is scaffold chrome. It therefore requires a verified JWT
 * on every method, and this module closes the one hole a JWT does not.
 *
 * The platform resolves a scope into an R2 prefix like this:
 *
 *   scope 'app'  ->  `apps/<resourceId>/`
 *   scope 'self' ->  `apps/<resourceId>/users/<userId>/`
 *
 * and its guard is `key.startsWith(prefix)`. Every user's private files are
 * strict DESCENDANTS of the app prefix, so a request that says `?scope=app`
 * while naming somebody else's key satisfies that check — one signed-in user
 * could read, overwrite or delete another user's files, and
 * `?scope=app&prefix=users/` would list every user's keys. Verifying the JWT
 * does not help: the hole is in the prefix arithmetic, not in the identity.
 *
 * So for scope 'app' — and only for scope 'app', scope 'self' is already
 * namespaced per user — refuse any request that names the `users` namespace.
 * A key can enter that namespace through three inputs, all covered here:
 *
 *   - the path, on a download or a delete;
 *   - `?key=`, which anchors an upload or a multipart part;
 *   - `?prefix=`, which selects what the list route enumerates.
 *
 * The path is decoded before the test, because an encoded slash (`%2Fusers%2F`)
 * or an encoded letter (`%75sers`) survives URL parsing intact and only becomes
 * a `users` path segment once decoded — which is exactly what the platform does
 * to it downstream. The query values arrive already decoded by URLSearchParams,
 * the same single decode the platform applies to them.
 *
 * Dot segments are refused too. That one is belt-and-braces rather than
 * load-bearing: WHATWG URL parsing collapses `..`, `.` and their encoded
 * spellings out of `url.pathname` before this sees them, and the platform's
 * own `sanitizeSubpath` rejects them again. It costs one comparison and keeps
 * the function honest if it is ever handed a raw, unparsed path.
